# MovieDatabase
This was a semester long project that I worked on with three others as a part of my Database Systems class. We decided to create a database of Movies.

There are several files in this repository

1. Database overciew: This is the inital diagram we designed for our database

2. Database presentation: This is the final presentation that we did for the class

3. Report1, Report2, View1, View2: These are all SQL files with sample queries for our database

4. Scripts 2.0: This is the SQL code to create our tables
